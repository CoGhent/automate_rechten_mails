<p>I hope this e-mail finds you well. I am Thijs Temmerman, collections employee at Design Museum Gent, and I write to you with regards to a work in our collection that was designed by you. <strong>At Design Museum Gent, we would like to make our collection digitally available. </strong>We want to share the heritage that has been entrusted to us with as many people as possible, except for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>We hold in our collection a <strong>vase designed by you for the 100% MakeUp Series of Alessandro Mendini</strong>. We have already received permission from the children of Mr Mendini and would also like to kindly ask you to grant a Creative Commons licence to the <strong>work in the attached list</strong>.</p>
<p>The consensus about these licences on the international museum scene is that they offer a fair framework for making works that are still subject to copyright digitally available. Granting these licences does not mean that you surrender the intellectual rights on the design of these works. It only means that you agree to the distribution of images of the works by us and by third parties, in accordance with the type of licence you granted.</p>
<p>The licence we would like you to grant is <strong>Creative Commons-licence CC BY-NC-ND 4.0</strong>. This licence means that the user can share the work <strong>under the following conditions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attribution (BY):</strong> the user must mention the name of the author of the work and include a link to the Creative Commons licence.</li>
<li><strong>Non-commercial use (NC): </strong>the reproductions must not be used for commercial purposes.</li>
<li><strong>No derivatives (ND): </strong>if the user adapts the reproduction, they are not allowed to share it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We would like the licence to automatically also apply to any additional (existing) works we may acquire from you in the future. In that case we will send you an updated version of the attachment.</p>
<p><strong>How to agree</strong></p>
<p>Please sign the attached form and return it to us by e-mail. Should you prefer a paper version, let us know and we will send you a copy by post.</p>
<p>If there are any other persons who have rights relating to these works, e.g. a co-author with whom you share the copyrights or a producer or a collective management organisation to whom you transferred your rights, please let us know, because by signing the form, you hold Design Museum Gent harmless against third-party claims.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like more information? </strong></p>
<p>Please do not hesitate to request further information via this e-mail address, or call +32 471 77 77 49.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We thank you in advance.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Thijs Temmerman</p>
